# Documentation Gap Analysis for System Rebuild

## What Another System Would Need vs. What We Have

### ✅ Already Sufficient

| Document | Path | Completeness |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| Business Requirements (BRD) | [name of BRD file in `docs/brd/`] | ✅ 100% |
| Import LC BRD | [name of Import LC BRD file in `docs/brd/`] | ✅ 100% |
| MT700 Field Spec | [name of MT700 Field Spec file in `docs/brd/MT/`] | ✅ 100% |
| Implementation Plan | `.agents/state/implementation_plan.md` | ✅ 95% |
| Consistency Report | [name of Consistency Report file in `docs/tds/`] | ✅ 100% |

### ❌ Missing / Insufficient for From-Scratch Rebuild

[List all the gaps you find. For each gap, provide the following information:]

| # | Gap | Why It's Needed | Severity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| 1 | **Technical Design Spec (TDS)** — Complete entity definitions with ALL field names, types, and relationships | The implementation plan says "30+ SWIFT fields" but doesn't list every one. Another AI cannot create `TradeFinanceEntities.xml` without the exact field spec. | 🔴 Critical |
| 2 | **Service Logic Spec** — Service signatures, parameters, AND business logic pseudocode | Services like `create#LcAmendment` (shadow record cloning) have complex Groovy logic. The plan describes WHAT but not HOW. | 🔴 Critical |
| 3 | **Screen Architecture Spec** — Moqui XML screen patterns and widget hierarchy for each screen | Another AI needs to know wrapper vs. subscreen patterns, `conditional-field` usage, `section-iterate` for status buttons, etc. | 🟡 High |
| 4 | **Moqui Setup Guide** — How to clone framework, create component, configure `MoquiConf.xml` | Basic bootstrapping instructions are not documented. | 🟡 High |
| 5 | **Security Configuration Spec** — Roles, artifact groups, authorization mappings | The actual XML exists in `20_TradeFinanceSecurityData.xml` but is not described in any doc. | 🟡 High |

### Proposed Solution

[propose solution to close the GAP, e.g if the TDS is missing, propose to create it. If the implementation plan is missing, propose to create it. If the consistency report is missing, propose to create it.]

[Example TDS Proposed Structure:]
1. **Moqui Setup & Bootstrap** — Framework clone, component creation, MoquiConf
2. **Entity Specification** — Every entity with every field (name, type, PK, defaults)
3. **Service Specification** — Every service with verb/noun, params, and logic pseudocode
4. **Status Flows & Seed Data** — Complete StatusFlow definitions and enumerations
5. **Security Configuration** — Roles, artifact groups, authorization matrix
6. **Screen Architecture** — Pattern templates for wrapper, find, and detail screens
7. **Demo Data Structure** — How to create representative test data

### Final Blueprint Package (After TDS Creation):
